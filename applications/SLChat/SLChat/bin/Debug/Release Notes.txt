Release Notes:


------------------------
Version 0.0.0.3
------------------------

Features:

	* Feature: Timestamps can be customized by adjusting time zone offset and format.
	* Feature: Can now chat on channels using "/<channel> <text>" and "//<text>".
	* Feature: Clicking links in richtextboxes should launch default browser with link.
	* Feature: Ctrl+A now works in chat textbox for local chat.
	* Feature: Improved names list handling, now done via key, so if an object changes its name, it changes on the list as well, also all objects now have "(Ob)" infront of their names (in the list) to better distinguish them from avatars.
	* Feature: Preferences can now be saved, current preferences include:
			** Using "You" or full name for yourself.
			** Toggling of showing your own name in the names list
			** Showing/hiding of timestamps for both IMs and/or local chat and other timestamp features.
			** Profiles can now be deleted through Preferences -> Profiles
	* Feature: IMs now show up as tabs in the main chat window (will be optional later).


Bug Fixes:

	* Fixed bug: Closing certain forms now work as you'd expect. I.e. you can close the Login window while the main chat window is open and the program will not completely exit. You can also Logout, open the login window, close the chat window, and the program will still run until you close the login window. File -> Exit from Chat Window will close the application regardless of what windows are open. If this behavior seems quirky or anti-user-friendly, let me know.
	* Fixed bug: Objects can no longer show up as "You" in chat by having the same name as you (thanks to Qode for finding this one). Also objects can no longer show up as "You" in the name list either.
	* Fixed bug: More grammar correction for chat, also fixed case where "s" would be appended to names.


------------------------
Version 0.0.0.2 (8/11/06)
------------------------

Features:

	* Feature: Now using Delta Czukor's SLeek code as a base to build off of. This should help things to run better and work more! Appologies for things that are yet commented, I'll get around to commenting more things as I go like the v0.0.0.1 had. Most of my time with v0.0.0.2 was changing things around based on the general idea I (Oz Spade) and I think Baba Yamamoto have for SLChat, some of this is still not complete, but it's mostly at the same point v0.0.0.1 was.
	* Feature: Can now shout and whisper. You can select the three types of chat to be sent from the drop-down box or you can use the keyboard commands:
		** Enter = Whatever is selected in drop-down (default is Say)
		** Ctrl+Enter = Shout (bypasses drop-down)
		** Ctrl+Shift+Enter = Whisper (bypasses drop-down)
	* Feature: Profiles! A profile is created upon saving login information, each profile is saved in its own folder in the "Profiles" folder found in the same directory as the .exe, so saving login information results in "Profiles\Bob_Smith\settings.xml" being the home for the settings for that profile. For now to delete a profile just delete the folder (will be added in the future).
	* Feature: Colored chat (Thanks to Delta Czukor for this! :D )! Chat is now colored based on a few things:
		** messages from the program are in a blue
		** messages from the SL system (server messages, etc.) are in a teal (similar to SLs)
		** messages from objects are green
		** messages from Lindens are in a Sienna like color (similar to forums)
	* Feature: Partial IMing! Thanks again to Delta Czukor you can now send and recieve IMs if someone else starts an IM with you. I plan to switch it from defaultly being a seperate window to being built into the main form. Also plan to initiate them in some way.
	
Bug Fixes:

	* Fixed bug: Incoming Shout/Whisper and /me are all handled properly now (or should be). Also propper grammar should work, i.e. "You shout" instead of "You shouts".
	
Known Bugs:

	* Known bug: Chat scrolls when chat history has focus. The proper behavior should be that it does not scroll so you can easily copy text out. The reason the way I had it before doesn't work is because of using the different way of adding text to the richbox, however this is nessisary for the colors to work in a good way. I have an idea how to fix this but haven't done it yet.
	* Known bug: Scroll bar for chat history likes to hide untill somethings fiddled with then it fixes itself. Not sure why this does this yet, but I'll figure it out. Probably something to do with that panel seperator.
	
In Planning:

	* Planning: To work on adding functionality to the IMs as well as adding stuff onto the main chat.
	* Planning: Add a way to delete profiles through preferences window along with other preferences.


-----------------------
Version 0.0.0.1 (8/2/06)
-----------------------

Bug Fixes:

	* Fixed bug: Auto-scroll not working unless Chat History is selected then deselected. (Fix: missed setting default value to true).
	* Fixed bug: Logging out then logging in causes double chat to be recieved. (Fix: Callback for ChatFromSimulator was being called in Login, causing a new callback to be created on each login)
	* Fixed bug?: Memory leakage. (Fix?: May have been caused by threading done for Login, this threading has been removed for now untill I can properly figure out how to do threading.)
	* Fixed Bug: Updated to match changes done in 1.11.1 protocol. Mostly pertaining to ChatFromSimulator.

Features:

	* Feature: Can now choose Login Location on Login screen, options are "Home" and "Last". URL specific locations do not work yet (working on it).
	* Feature: Can now save Login information. Information will be saved to "settings.xml", located in the same directory as SLChat.exe. Password is not saved (will be in the future when hashes can be sent directly).

In Progress:

	* Progress: Working on sending/recieving IMs, the idea is to have a new tab pop up for each IM recieved in the main chat window, however I can't figure out how to get this to work, so for now it doesn't.
