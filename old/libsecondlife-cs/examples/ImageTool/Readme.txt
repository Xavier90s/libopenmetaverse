SecondLife uses Kakadu Software's JPEG2000 framework to compress and expand images to/from JPEG2000.

Libsecondlife currently makes use of a freely available set of command line tools from Kakadu to support Image upload and download from SecondLife.

These tools are available from Kakadu's website at http://www.kakadusoftware.com/
