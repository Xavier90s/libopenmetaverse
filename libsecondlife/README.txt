Building libsecondlife
----------------------

libsecondlife has two primary build systems, NAnt and Microsoft Visual Studio.

To use NAnt first download it from http://nant.sourceforge.net/ and then 
simply run "nant" in the top directory containing libsecondlife.build, or run 
"nant package" to build a zip file containing the executables and libraries.

To use the Visual Studio project files, you must be running Visual Studio 2005
or compatible software (including Visual C# Express 2005 and SharpDevelop, 
possibly MonoDevelop). Simply open the libsecondlife.sln solution and begin 
compiling. The output will be in the bin folder under the root directory.
